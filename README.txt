Readme
		To successfully run this application you will need to download Python 2.7.10 from the python website below
		https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/ 
		also select the version that matches your operating system.
		
		After successfully installing Python 2.7.10 in the main folder, right click the entertainment_center.py
		file then click open.
		
		Once the application runs it should open a browser window showing some of my favorite movies, which you can
		see the movies box art, title, rating, and release year. Also if you click on the box art you will be presented 
		with videos of the movies.
